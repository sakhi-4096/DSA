Exploring data structures and algorithms.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to provide resources, explanations, and implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer aiming to refresh your knowledge, this repository aims to cater to your needs.

## Structure
The repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific topic or concept. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:
* **Data Structures**: This directory contains implementations and explanations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
* **Algorithms**: Here, you'll find implementations of classic algorithms including sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search), and others.
* **Examples**: This directory includes practical examples and applications of data structures and algorithms in action. You'll find code snippets, demos, and explanations showcasing how these concepts are used in real-world scenarios.
* **Resources**: In this directory, you'll find additional resources, references, and links to external tutorials, articles, and videos that can further enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
